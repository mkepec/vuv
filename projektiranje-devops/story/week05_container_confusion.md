# Week 5: Container Confusion - "Dependency Hell" 🐳
**VelocityTech Transformation Week 5**

**Story Context:** Applications break due to library conflicts, deployment environments differ drastically from development  
**Focus:** Implementing containerization to solve dependency management and environment consistency  
**Characters in Focus:** Filip's server maintenance nightmares, Luka's "it works in my container," Ana's testing environment chaos

---

## 🔥 The Weekly Crisis: "The Great Dependency Disaster"
**Setting:** VelocityTech office, Thursday 7:45 AM. Filip's coffee is already cold from his 3 AM server maintenance.  
**The Problem:** Payment gateway works in CI, but production deployment fails due to conflicting system libraries

**Scene:** [VelocityTech main development floor. Filip looks exhausted, surrounded by multiple laptops showing different server terminals. Ana staring at her testing environment with growing confusion. Luka debugging why his code works differently on the production server.]

**FILIP** *(rubbing his eyes, speaking to three different terminals)*  
> "Production server has Python 3.8, staging has 3.9, and development has 3.10..."  
> "The payment gateway's crypto library requires OpenSSL 1.1.1, but production has 1.0.2..."  
> *(frustrated sigh)* "I spent the entire night trying to upgrade libraries without breaking the legacy apps."

**LUKA** *(frantically checking his local setup)*  
> "But it works perfectly in my CI pipeline! All tests pass!"  
> "The container in GitHub Actions has all the right versions..."  
> *(pointing at his screen)* "Look - Node 18.17.0, PostgreSQL 14, Redis 7... everything's perfect!"

**ANA** *(switching between three different testing environments)*  
> "I need to test on the QA server, but it has different library versions than staging..."  
> "The payment validation behaves differently because of OpenSSL version differences!"  
> *(overwhelmed)* "How am I supposed to test when every environment is a different puzzle?"

**MAJA** *(checking project timeline, stress evident)*  
> "Client goes live next week. We can't tell them 'it works in some environments but not others.'"  
> "Filip, how long to make production match the CI environment?"

**FILIP** *(looking at a maintenance schedule)*  
> "If I upgrade the production server, I risk breaking three other applications..."  
> "The legacy CRM system only works with the old Python version..."  
> *(to Maja)* "Maybe... two weeks of careful upgrades? If everything goes perfectly."

**LUKA** *(defensive)*  
> "This isn't a code problem! My application is fine!"  
> "It's an infrastructure problem. Can't you just make the servers match?"

**FILIP** *(exhausted)*  
> "Each server is a unique snowflake. They've evolved over years of patches and updates..."  
> "Server A has this version, Server B has that version, and nobody remembers why."

**ANA** *(frustrated)*  
> "I can't certify something that behaves differently in production!"  
> "What if the crypto library differences cause payment failures with certain card types?"

**MARKO** *(entering, immediately recognizing the pattern)*  
> "Let me guess - application works fine, but server environments are all different?"  
> *(to you)* "This is the classic dependency hell. Ready to learn how containers solve this?"

**MAJA** *(desperately)*  
> "There has to be a way to package the application with its exact dependencies..."  
> "So it works the same everywhere, regardless of what's on the server?"

**[All eyes turn to you. The intern who might know about modern deployment practices.]**

**FILIP** *(hopeful but skeptical)*  
> "I've heard about Docker, but isn't that just more complexity?"  
> "More tools to maintain, more things that can break?"

**[Your systems thinking engages. This isn't just about libraries - it's about inconsistent environments creating unpredictable behavior.]**

## 🎯 What We'll Master This Week
**By the end of this week, you'll be able to:**
1. **Create production-ready Docker containers** - Build lightweight, secure images that package applications with all dependencies
2. **Implement multi-stage builds for optimization** - Create efficient containers that separate build dependencies from runtime requirements
3. **Design container orchestration for local development** - Use Docker Compose to replicate production environments exactly

**Real-world Connection:** Container skills are essential in modern Croatian IT companies. Organizations like Infobip, Rimac, and Span have fully containerized their applications for reliability and scalability. Docker expertise is one of the most requested skills in Croatian DevOps job postings.

### Containerization Principles and the Problem They Solve
**The Problem it Solves:** Dependency conflicts, environment inconsistencies, "works on my machine" syndrome, complex deployment processes  
**How it Works:** Containers package applications with all their dependencies, creating consistent runtime environments everywhere

**Container vs Virtual Machine:**
```
Virtual Machine:           Container:
┌─────────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────────┐
│     Application     │   │     Application     │
│                     │   │                     │
│   Guest OS (GB)     │   │   Container Engine  │
│                     │   │                     │
│   Hypervisor        │   │     Host OS         │
│                     │   │                     │
│     Host OS         │   │     Hardware        │
│                     │   │                     │
│     Hardware        │   └─────────────────────┘
└─────────────────────┘
Heavy, slow startup        Light, fast startup
```

**Key Container Benefits:**
- **Consistency:** Same environment from development to production
- **Isolation:** Applications don't interfere with each other
- **Portability:** Run anywhere containers are supported
- **Efficiency:** Share host OS kernel, use fewer resources
- **Scalability:** Start/stop quickly, orchestrate easily

**Real-world Example:** Netflix runs thousands of containerized microservices, ensuring consistent behavior across their global infrastructure  
**VelocityTech Connection:** Containers would eliminate Filip's server maintenance nightmares and environment inconsistencies

### Docker Fundamentals and Best Practices
**The Problem it Solves:** Complex application packaging, dependency management, deployment consistency  
**How it Works:** Docker creates lightweight, portable containers from declarative instructions

**Docker Core Components:**
- **Dockerfile:** Instructions for building container images
- **Images:** Read-only templates for creating containers
- **Containers:** Running instances of images
- **Registry:** Storage for sharing images (Docker Hub, etc.)

**Dockerfile Best Practices:**
```dockerfile
# Use specific base image versions
FROM node:18.17.0-alpine

# Use non-root user for security
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S nodejs -u 1001

# Copy dependency files first for better caching
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force

# Copy application code
COPY --chown=nodejs:nodejs . .

# Switch to non-root user
USER nodejs

# Expose port and define startup command
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "src/server.js"]
```

**Image Optimization Strategies:**
- **Use Alpine Linux:** Smaller base images (5MB vs 100MB+)
- **Multi-stage builds:** Separate build and runtime dependencies
- **Layer caching:** Order instructions by frequency of change
- **Security scanning:** Check for vulnerabilities in base images

**Real-world Example:** Google's container registry serves billions of container pulls daily with optimized, secure images  
**VelocityTech Connection:** Proper Dockerfiles would package the payment gateway with exact dependencies

### Multi-Stage Dockerfiles and Production Optimization
**The Problem it Solves:** Large container images, build tools in production, security vulnerabilities from unnecessary dependencies  
**How it Works:** Multiple FROM statements create intermediate images, copying only what's needed to final image

**Multi-Stage Build Example:**
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build environment
FROM node:18.17.0 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
RUN npm run test

# Stage 2: Production environment
FROM node:18.17.0-alpine AS production
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
    adduser -S nodejs -u 1001

WORKDIR /app

# Copy only production dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production && \
    npm cache clean --force

# Copy built application from builder stage
COPY --from=builder --chown=nodejs:nodejs /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder --chown=nodejs:nodejs /app/src ./src

USER nodejs
EXPOSE 3000
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1

CMD ["node", "src/server.js"]
```

**Container Security Best Practices:**
- **Non-root users:** Never run as root inside containers
- **Minimal base images:** Fewer packages = smaller attack surface
- **Regular updates:** Keep base images updated
- **Secrets management:** Never embed secrets in images
- **Health checks:** Monitor container health automatically

**Real-world Example:** Spotify uses multi-stage builds to create minimal production images while maintaining rich development environments  
**VelocityTech Connection:** Multi-stage builds would create secure, efficient containers for the payment gateway

**Key Takeaways:**
- Containers solve dependency hell by packaging everything together
- Docker provides consistent environments from development to production
- Multi-stage builds optimize for both security and performance
- Container orchestration enables complex application architectures

## 🛠️ Lab Mission: "The Container Revolution"
**Scenario:** VelocityTech's payment gateway works in development but fails in production due to library conflicts  
**Your Mission:** Containerize the application to eliminate environment dependencies and ensure consistent behavior  
**Success Criteria:** Payment gateway runs identically in development, testing, and production containers

### Phase 1: Basic Containerization (60 minutes)
**Objective:** Create a working Docker container for VelocityTech's payment gateway

**Steps:**
1. **Create Initial Dockerfile**
   ```dockerfile
   # Dockerfile
   FROM node:18.17.0-alpine
   
   # Create app directory
   WORKDIR /app
   
   # Copy package files
   COPY package*.json ./
   
   # Install dependencies
   RUN npm ci --only=production
   
   # Copy application code
   COPY . .
   
   # Create non-root user
   RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
       adduser -S nodejs -u 1001 && \
       chown -R nodejs:nodejs /app
   
   USER nodejs
   
   # Expose port
   EXPOSE 3000
   
   # Health check
   HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
     CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
   
   # Start command
   CMD ["npm", "start"]
   ```
   - Expected output: Dockerfile that builds successfully
   - Troubleshooting: If build fails, check that all files are in the correct directory

2. **Build and Test Container Locally**
   ```bash
   # Build the container image
   docker build -t velocitytech/payment-gateway:latest .
   
   # Verify image was created
   docker images | grep velocitytech
   
   # Run container locally
   docker run -d \
     --name payment-gateway-test \
     -p 3000:3000 \
     -e NODE_ENV=development \
     -e DB_HOST=host.docker.internal \
     -e DB_PORT=5432 \
     -e DB_NAME=payment_dev \
     -e DB_USER=dev_user \
     -e DB_PASSWORD=dev_password \
     velocitytech/payment-gateway:latest
   
   # Test that container is running
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   echo "Expected: {'status': 'healthy', 'timestamp': '...'}"
   
   # Check container logs
   docker logs payment-gateway-test
   
   # Stop and remove test container
   docker stop payment-gateway-test
   docker rm payment-gateway-test
   ```

3. **Create .dockerignore for Optimization**
   ```bash
   # .dockerignore
   node_modules
   npm-debug.log
   .git
   .gitignore
   README.md
   .env
   .nyc_output
   coverage
   .nyc_output
   .coverage
   .vscode
   .idea
   *.log
   .DS_Store
   Thumbs.db
   tests/
   docs/
   .github/
   ```

4. **Add Container Scripts to Package.json**
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "docker:build": "docker build -t velocitytech/payment-gateway:latest .",
       "docker:run": "docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env velocitytech/payment-gateway:latest",
       "docker:dev": "docker run -it -p 3000:3000 -v $(pwd):/app --env-file .env velocitytech/payment-gateway:latest sh",
       "docker:logs": "docker logs -f payment-gateway",
       "docker:stop": "docker stop payment-gateway && docker rm payment-gateway"
     }
   }
   ```

**Checkpoint:** Basic containerized application runs successfully with proper health checks

### Phase 2: Multi-Stage Production Optimization (75 minutes)
**Objective:** Create optimized, secure production containers using multi-stage builds

**Steps:**
1. **Create Multi-Stage Dockerfile**
   ```dockerfile
   # Multi-stage Dockerfile
   
   # Stage 1: Build and test environment
   FROM node:18.17.0 AS builder
   WORKDIR /app
   
   # Copy package files for dependency installation
   COPY package*.json ./
   RUN npm ci
   
   # Copy source code
   COPY . .
   
   # Run tests to ensure quality
   RUN npm run test
   
   # Build application (if you have a build step)
   RUN npm run build || echo "No build step defined"
   
   # Run security audit
   RUN npm audit --audit-level high
   
   # Stage 2: Production runtime environment
   FROM node:18.17.0-alpine AS production
   
   # Install security updates
   RUN apk update && apk upgrade && apk add --no-cache curl
   
   # Create non-root user
   RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs && \
       adduser -S nodejs -u 1001
   
   WORKDIR /app
   
   # Copy package files
   COPY package*.json ./
   
   # Install only production dependencies
   RUN npm ci --only=production && \
       npm cache clean --force
   
   # Copy application code from builder stage
   COPY --from=builder --chown=nodejs:nodejs /app/src ./src
   COPY --from=builder --chown=nodejs:nodejs /app/config ./config
   
   # Copy any built assets (if applicable)
   # COPY --from=builder --chown=nodejs:nodejs /app/dist ./dist
   
   # Switch to non-root user
   USER nodejs
   
   # Expose port
   EXPOSE 3000
   
   # Add health check
   HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
     CMD curl -f http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1
   
   # Define startup command
   CMD ["node", "src/server.js"]
   ```

2. **Build and Compare Image Sizes**
   ```bash
   # Build multi-stage image
   docker build -t velocitytech/payment-gateway:optimized .
   
   # Compare image sizes
   echo "=== Image Size Comparison ==="
   docker images | grep velocitytech
   
   # Should see significant size reduction with multi-stage build
   # Example output:
   # velocitytech/payment-gateway  optimized  123MB
   # velocitytech/payment-gateway  latest     245MB
   
   # Inspect image layers
   docker history velocitytech/payment-gateway:optimized
   
   # Test optimized container
   docker run -d \
     --name payment-gateway-optimized \
     -p 3001:3000 \
     -e NODE_ENV=production \
     -e DB_HOST=host.docker.internal \
     -e DB_PORT=5432 \
     velocitytech/payment-gateway:optimized
   
   # Verify it works
   curl http://localhost:3001/health
   
   # Check security - container should not run as root
   docker exec payment-gateway-optimized whoami
   # Expected output: nodejs
   
   # Clean up
   docker stop payment-gateway-optimized
   docker rm payment-gateway-optimized
   ```

3. **Create Container Security Configuration**
   ```bash
   # Create docker-compose.security.yml for security best practices
   cat > docker-compose.security.yml << 'EOF'
   version: '3.8'
   
   services:
     payment-gateway:
       image: velocitytech/payment-gateway:optimized
       container_name: payment-gateway-secure
       restart: unless-stopped
       
       # Security configurations
       read_only: true
       tmpfs:
         - /tmp:noexec,nosuid,size=128m
       
       # Resource limits
       deploy:
         resources:
           limits:
             cpus: '0.5'
             memory: 256M
           reservations:
             cpus: '0.25'
             memory: 128M
       
       # Security options
       security_opt:
         - no-new-privileges:true
       
       # Network security
       networks:
         - payment-network
       
       # Environment variables (use secrets in production)
       environment:
         - NODE_ENV=production
         - DB_HOST=postgres
         - DB_PORT=5432
         - DB_NAME=payment_prod
       
       # Health check
       healthcheck:
         test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000/health"]
         interval: 30s
         timeout: 10s
         retries: 3
         start_period: 40s
       
       ports:
         - "3000:3000"
       
       depends_on:
         postgres:
           condition: service_healthy
   
   networks:
     payment-network:
       driver: bridge
   EOF
   ```

4. **Container Vulnerability Scanning**
   ```bash
   # Install and run container security scanner
   # Using Trivy (if available) or basic security checks
   
   # Check for known vulnerabilities
   docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
     aquasec/trivy:latest image velocitytech/payment-gateway:optimized || echo "Trivy not available, skipping scan"
   
   # Basic security validation
   echo "=== Container Security Validation ==="
   
   # Check that container doesn't run as root
   docker run --rm velocitytech/payment-gateway:optimized whoami
   
   # Verify no unnecessary packages in Alpine
   docker run --rm velocitytech/payment-gateway:optimized sh -c "apk list --installed | wc -l"
   
   # Check file permissions
   docker run --rm velocitytech/payment-gateway:optimized ls -la /app
   ```

   volumes:
     postgres_data:
     redis_data:
   
   networks:
     velocitytech-network:
       driver: bridge
   ```

2. **Create Database Initialization Script**
   ```sql
   -- scripts/init-db.sql
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";
   
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS payments (
       id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY,
       transaction_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
       amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
       currency VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'EUR',
       card_number_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
       customer_email VARCHAR(255),
       status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
       created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
       updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
   );
   
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_transaction_id ON payments(transaction_id);
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_status ON payments(status);
   CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_payments_created_at ON payments(created_at);
   
   -- Insert test data for development
   INSERT INTO payments (transaction_id, amount, currency, card_number_hash, customer_email, status)
   VALUES 
       ('TXN_TEST_001', 100.00, 'EUR', 'hash_4111', 'test1@velocitytech.com', 'completed'),
       ('TXN_TEST_002', 250.50, 'EUR', 'hash_4222', 'test2@velocitytech.com', 'completed'),
       ('TXN_TEST_003', 75.25, 'EUR', 'hash_4333', 'test3@velocitytech.com', 'pending')
   ON CONFLICT (transaction_id) DO NOTHING;
   ```

3. **Create Development Scripts**
   ```bash
   # Create convenience scripts
   
   # scripts/dev-start.sh
   cat > scripts/dev-start.sh << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Starting VelocityTech development environment..."
   
   # Build latest image
   docker-compose build
   
   # Start all services
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Wait for services to be healthy
   echo "Waiting for services to start..."
   sleep 10
   
   # Check service health
   docker-compose ps
   
   # Run database migrations if needed
   # docker-compose exec payment-gateway npm run migrate
   
   echo "Development environment ready!"
   echo "Payment Gateway: http://localhost:3000"
   echo "PostgreSQL: localhost:5432"

4. **Test Complete Environment**
   ```bash
   # Start the complete development environment
   ./scripts/dev-start.sh
   
   # Wait for all services to be ready
   sleep 30
   
   # Test database connectivity
   docker-compose exec postgres psql -U dev_user -d payment_dev -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments;"
   
   # Test Redis connectivity
   docker-compose exec redis redis-cli ping
   
   # Test payment gateway health
   curl http://localhost:3000/health
   
   # Test payment processing
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/payments/process \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "amount": 99.99,
       "cardNumber": "4111111111111111",
       "expiryDate": "12/25",
       "cvv": "123",
       "customerEmail": "test@example.com"
     }'
   
   # View logs
   ./scripts/dev-logs.sh payment-gateway
   
   # Stop environment
   ./scripts/dev-stop.sh
   ```

**Checkpoint:** Complete containerized development environment with all dependencies running consistently

### Validation & Testing
**How to verify everything works:**
1. **Container Build Test** - `docker build completes successfully with optimized image size`
2. **Security Test** - `Container runs as non-root user with proper permissions`
3. **Environment Test** - `Complete stack starts and all services are healthy`
4. **Integration Test** - `Payment processing works through containerized stack`

**Expected Results:**
- **Image Size:** Multi-stage build reduces image size by 40-60%
- **Security:** Container runs as non-root user, passes basic security checks
- **Consistency:** Same environment from development to production
- **Startup Time:** Complete stack ready in under 2 minutes
- **Resource Usage:** Efficient memory and CPU utilization with proper limits

## 🔧 New Tools in Your Arsenal

### Docker Engine and CLI
- **Purpose:** Build, run, and manage containers consistently across environments
- **Key Commands:**
  - `docker build -t name:tag .` - Build image from Dockerfile
  - `docker run -d -p 8080:3000 image` - Run container in background
  - `docker logs container-name` - View container logs
- **Pro Tips:** Use specific image tags, not 'latest' in production
- **Common Pitfalls:** Don't store data in containers, use volumes for persistence

### Docker Compose Orchestration
- **Purpose:** Define and run multi-container applications with dependencies
- **Key Features:**
  - Service dependencies with health checks
  - Network isolation between services
  - Volume management for data persistence
- **Pro Tips:** Use override files for environment-specific configs
- **Common Pitfalls:** Don't use docker-compose in production, use proper orchestrators

### Multi-Stage Dockerfile Optimization
- **Purpose:** Create minimal, secure production images while maintaining rich build environments
- **Key Strategies:**
  - Separate build dependencies from runtime
  - Copy only necessary files to final stage
  - Use Alpine Linux for smaller base images
- **Pro Tips:** Order layers by frequency of change for better caching
- **Common Pitfalls:** Don't include build tools or source code in production images

## 🔧 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue #1: "Container builds but won't start"
**Symptoms:** Docker build succeeds, but `docker run` fails immediately
**Cause:** Missing dependencies, wrong startup command, or permission issues
**Solution:**
```bash
# Debug container interactively
docker run -it --entrypoint sh velocitytech/payment-gateway:latest

# Check what's actually in the container
ls -la /app
whoami
node --version

# Test startup command manually
node src/server.js
```
**Prevention:** Always test containers interactively before automating

### Issue #2: "Can't connect to database from container"
**Symptoms:** Application works locally but fails to connect to database in container
**Cause:** Network configuration issues, using localhost instead of service names
**Solution:**
```bash
# Use service names in docker-compose
DB_HOST=postgres  # Not localhost
DB_HOST=redis     # Not 127.0.0.1

# Check network connectivity
docker-compose exec payment-gateway ping postgres
docker-compose exec payment-gateway nslookup postgres
```
**Prevention:** Use Docker Compose service names for inter-container communication

### Issue #3: "Container image is too large"
**Symptoms:** Docker images are several GB, slow to build and deploy
**Cause:** Including unnecessary files, not using multi-stage builds, large base images
**Solution:**
```dockerfile
# Use Alpine base images
FROM node:18-alpine  # Instead of node:18

# Use .dockerignore
echo "node_modules" >> .dockerignore
echo "*.log" >> .dockerignore

# Multi-stage builds
FROM node:18 AS builder
# ... build steps
FROM node:18-alpine AS production
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
```
**Prevention:** Always use multi-stage builds and .dockerignore for production images
