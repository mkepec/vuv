### 📍 **SCENE: VelocityTech Solutions Office - Zagreb**
### ⏰ **TIME: Friday, May 23rd, 17:45**
### 🌅 **WEATHER: Beautiful spring evening outside... chaos inside**

---

## ACT I: THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM

**[CAMERA OPENS]** *Modern office space. Laptops scattered on desks. Empty coffee cups. Post-it notes everywhere. Golden hour sunlight streams through windows...*

**[YOU]** *Walking nervously through the office, clutching your internship paperwork*

**MARKO** *(turning from his monitor, friendly but slightly stressed smile)*  
> "Ah, perfect timing! You must be our new DevOps intern. I'm Marko, your mentor."  
> *(extends hand)* "Welcome to VelocityTech! I've been here for three months myself."

**[YOU]** *(shaking hands)*  
> "Thanks! Excited to be here. Three months? So you're relatively new too?"

**MARKO** *(nodding)*  
> "Yeah, they brought me in to help modernize their development practices."  
> *(lowering voice)* "Between you and me, there's a lot of work to do."  
> *(normal voice)* "But that's why you're here - transformation is a team effort!"

**[MARKO's face changes. The color drains.]**

**MARKO** *(muttering)*  
> "Oh no. Oh no no no. Not today. Not on Friday."

---

## ACT II: WHEN EVERYTHING GOES WRONG

**[CAMERA PANS]** *Sudden movement across the office. Multiple phones ringing. Slack notifications pinging like machine guns.*

**FILIP** *(Operations Engineer, running past with laptop, screen showing red error messages)*  
> "Marko! Production is down! The deployment is failing!"  
> *(reading from terminal)* "Database connection timeout... authentication service unreachable..."
> *(shouting to no one in particular)* "Why do we always deploy on Fridays?!"

**LEGACY LUKA** *(Senior Developer, not looking up from his screen showing stack traces)*  
> "I told you the new authentication module wasn't ready. Look at this error log!"  
> *(pointing at screen)* "ClassNotFoundException: AuthTokenValidator... I knew it!"
> *(typing furiously)* "This is exactly why I don't trust these 'modern' practices."

**ANA** *(QA Engineer, frantically opening multiple browser tabs)*  
> "Wait, which version did we deploy? I thought I was still testing the payment integration!"  
> *(voice rising)* "I haven't finished regression testing! How can we be in production?!"

**[PHONE RINGS. Everyone freezes.]**

**MAJA** *(Project Manager, answering her phone with forced calm)*  
> "Hello, VelocityTech Solutions... Yes, I understand the checkout isn't working..."  
> *(covering phone, hissing to the team)* "The client is getting angry emails from customers!"

---

## ACT III: THE CRISIS DEEPENS

**[MONTAGE: 18:00 - 19:30]** *The office fills with the aroma of emergency pizza delivery and instant coffee*

**FILIP** *(sweating, multiple SSH sessions open, terminal showing database errors)*  
> "I'm trying to rollback but the database migration already ran!"  
> *(reading from screen)* "ERROR: Cannot rollback migration_v2.4.1 - foreign key constraints..."
> "Someone needs to manually fix 50,000 customer records!"

**LUKA** *(defensive, showing his local development environment)*  
> "My code worked fine in development. Look - localhost runs perfectly!"  
> *(switching between windows)* "It's probably a server configuration issue."  
> "These containers just make everything more complicated than simple JARs!"

**ANA** *(overwhelmed, opening a thick Excel spreadsheet)*  
> "I need at least 3 hours to test the rollback properly..."  
> "But if we wait that long, we'll lose the weekend!"

**MAJA** *(juggling three phone calls)*  
> "Can we push a hotfix in 30 minutes? The client is threatening to cancel the contract!"  
> "What do you mean 'we don't know what caused it'?!"

**[MARKO catches your eye. You're standing in the middle of organized chaos, watching your first day unfold.]**

**MARKO** *(walking over, speaking quietly with a mix of frustration and determination)*  
> "So... this is what I was hired to fix. VelocityTech on a typical Friday deployment."  
> *(sighs)* "Management brought me in three months ago after the last major outage."  
> "Want to know the worst part?"

**[YOU]** *(wide-eyed)*  
> "This... happens regularly?"

**MARKO** *(nodding grimly)*  
> "Every. Single. Month. Since I started."  
> "I've been trying to implement changes, but..." *(gestures at the chaos)*  
> "One person can't transform an entire company culture."  
> *(looks at you directly)* "That's why I requested an intern. I need help."

---

## ACT IV: THE REVELATION

**[CAMERA CLOSES IN]** *The office is now dimly lit. Pizza boxes scattered on desks, the smell of cold coffee lingering. It's 21:30.*

**FILIP** *(exhausted, leaning back in his chair, Slack notifications still pinging)*  
> "Okay, rollback is complete. Customers can check out again."  
> *(rubbing his eyes)* "But I have no idea what we're going to tell the client about those 50,000 corrupted user profiles."

**LUKA** *(packing up his laptop, muttering while closing multiple IDE windows)*  
> "Well, at least it's fixed. My localhost environment is still clean..."  
> *(under his breath)* "If they'd just let me deploy the WAR file directly like the old days..."
> *(louder)* "See you Monday. Assuming nothing else breaks over the weekend..."

**ANA** *(still at her desk, surrounded by test plans)*  
> "I'll stay and prep test scenarios for Monday's fix."  
> "Someone has to make sure this doesn't happen again..."

**MAJA** *(hanging up her phone, exhausted)*  
> "Client is... not happy. But they're not canceling. Yet."  
> "We need to fix our processes. This can't keep happening."

**[EVERYONE has left except MARKO and YOU]**

**MARKO** *(turning to face you)*  
> "So. Still want to do that internship?"

**[YOU]** *(hesitating)*  
> "Is it always like this?"

**MARKO** *(small smile)*  
> "Not after we're done with it."  
> "That's why you're here. That's why we need DevOps."  
> *(walking to the whiteboard, picking up a marker)*  
> "What you just witnessed? That's what happens when good people work in bad systems."

## ACT V: THE MISSION

**[MARKO draws on the whiteboard]**

```
Current State:          Future State:
- 30 days to production    2 hours
- Monthly deployments      On-demand  
- 4 hours to fix issues    5 minutes
- 30% failure rate        2% failure rate
- Team stress level: 9/10  Team happiness: 9/10
```

**MARKO** *(tapping the board with renewed energy)*  
> "I've seen this transformation work at my previous company."  
> "Filip doesn't have to work weekends."  
> "Ana doesn't have to manually test everything."  
> "Luka's code works the same everywhere."  
> "Maja can promise delivery dates with confidence."  
> "But I can't do it alone. Cultural change needs champions at every level."

**[YOU]** *(looking at the board)*  
> "That sounds... challenging. How do you change an entire company?"

**MARKO** *(grinning)*  
> "One week at a time. One process at a time. One person at a time."  
> "I bring the experience, you bring the fresh energy and perspective."  
> *(extends hand)* "Partners in transformation?"

**[YOU]** *(shaking hands, determined)*  
> "Let's transform VelocityTech."

**[CAMERA PULLS BACK]** *The whiteboard glows under the office lights. Two figures shake hands. Outside, Zagreb sparkles in the night.*

**[FADE TO BLACK]**
