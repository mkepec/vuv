# Week 4: Build Mayhem - "It Works on My Machine" ‚öôÔ∏è
**VelocityTech Transformation Week 4**

**Story Context:** Applications work perfectly on developer laptops but mysteriously fail in test environments  
**Focus:** Implementing Continuous Integration and establishing consistent build environments  
**Characters in Focus:** Luka's environment inconsistencies, Ana's testing frustrations, Filip's deployment chaos

---

## üî• The Weekly Crisis: "The Great Environment Mystery"
**Setting:** VelocityTech office, Wednesday 2:30 PM. Demo preparation in full swing.  
**The Problem:** Payment gateway works flawlessly on Luka's laptop but crashes instantly in the test environment

**Scene:** [VelocityTech main development floor. Luka's laptop connected to the big screen for client demo prep. Ana frantically switching between different environments. Filip on his third coffee, surrounded by server logs.]

**LUKA** *(pointing at his screen triumphantly)*  
> "See? Perfect! The payment gateway processes transactions flawlessly!"  
> "User authentication, payment validation, transaction completion - everything works!"  
> *(clicking through the demo flow)* "This is exactly what the client wants to see tomorrow."

**MAJA** *(checking her presentation notes)*  
> "Excellent! Now let's just deploy this to the demo environment for the client presentation."  
> "They want to test it themselves during the meeting."

**FILIP** *(typing deployment commands)*  
> "Pushing to test environment now... annnnd... deployed."  
> *(pausing, staring at error logs)* "Uh oh."

**ANA** *(refreshing the test environment page repeatedly)*  
> "It's returning a 500 error. 'Database connection failed.'"  
> "But wait... now I'm getting 'Module not found: payment-validator'"  
> *(confused)* "Luka, what version of Node.js are you running?"

**LUKA** *(defensively)*  
> "Node 18.2.0, same as always. And I have all the dependencies installed!"  
> "It works perfectly here! Look!" *(clicking frantically on his local version)*

**FILIP** *(diving into server logs)*  
> "Test environment is running Node 16.8.0... PostgreSQL version 12..."  
> "Your local setup has PostgreSQL 14 and completely different environment variables."  
> *(rubbing his temples)* "Plus the test server is missing half the npm packages."

**ANA** *(testing on her machine)*  
> "I can't even get it to start on my laptop! Some dependency version conflict..."  
> "How am I supposed to test something that only works on one specific machine?"

**MAJA** *(panic creeping into her voice)*  
> "The client demo is tomorrow at 10 AM! We promised them a working system!"  
> "Are you telling me we have software that only works on Luka's laptop?"

**LUKA** *(frustrated)*  
> "This is exactly why I don't like updating my development environment!"  
> "Once you get it working, you don't touch it! 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it!'"

**FILIP** *(on phone with IT, exasperated)*  
> "Can we install Node 18 on the test server? What do you mean 'security approval needed'?"  
> "The demo is TOMORROW!"

**MARKO** *(entering the chaos, immediately assessing)*  
> "Let me guess - the classic 'works on my machine' syndrome?"  
> *(to you)* "This is exactly why we need consistent, automated build processes. Ready to solve the environment mystery?"

**ANA** *(overwhelmed)*  
> "I spend more time trying to replicate environments than actually testing!"  
> "Every developer has their own special setup. It's like archaeological excavation!"

**[All eyes turn to you - the intern who might have some ideas about modern build practices.]**

**MAJA** *(desperately)*  
> "Is there a way to make code work the same everywhere?"  
> "Please tell me there's a solution that doesn't involve buying identical laptops for everyone!"

**[Your systems thinking activates. This isn't about hardware - it's about inconsistent processes and environments.]**

## üéØ What We'll Master This Week
**By the end of this week, you'll be able to:**
1. **Implement Continuous Integration pipelines** - Set up GitHub Actions workflows that automatically build, test, and validate every code change
2. **Create consistent build environments** - Ensure code works the same way across development, testing, and production environments
3. **Establish automated quality gates** - Implement checks that prevent broken code from reaching shared environments

**Real-world Connection:** CI/CD skills are essential in modern Croatian IT companies. Organizations like Infobip, Rimac, and Span rely heavily on automated build processes to maintain code quality and deployment reliability. These automation skills immediately differentiate you in the job market.

## üìö The Knowledge Foundation

### Continuous Integration Principles and Benefits
**The Problem it Solves:** Code works differently in different environments, integration issues discovered late, manual build processes prone to human error  
**How it Works:** Every code change triggers automated build, test, and validation processes in consistent environments

**Core CI Principles:**
- **Frequent Integration:** Developers integrate code changes multiple times per day
- **Automated Builds:** Every integration triggers automatic build process
- **Self-Testing Builds:** Builds include automated test execution
- **Fast Feedback:** Developers know within minutes if their changes broke something
- **Consistent Environments:** Same build process runs everywhere

**CI/CD Pipeline Stages:**
```
Code Commit ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Static Analysis ‚Üí Artifact Storage ‚Üí Deploy
     ‚Üì         ‚Üì      ‚Üì         ‚Üì              ‚Üì            ‚Üì
   Trigger   Compile  Unit    Code Quality   Package    Environment
            Check    Tests    Security       Version    Deployment  
```

**Real-world Example:** Netflix runs thousands of builds daily, catching issues before they affect millions of users  
**VelocityTech Connection:** Automated builds would have caught environment differences before the demo disaster

### GitHub Actions Fundamentals and Workflow Design
**The Problem it Solves:** Manual build processes, inconsistent environments, no automation of repetitive tasks  
**How it Works:** YAML-defined workflows automatically execute on code changes, pull requests, or scheduled triggers

**GitHub Actions Architecture:**
- **Workflows:** YAML files defining automated processes
- **Jobs:** Groups of steps that run on the same runner
- **Steps:** Individual tasks within a job
- **Actions:** Reusable units of code
- **Runners:** Virtual machines that execute workflows

**Basic Workflow Structure:**
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
      - run: npm run build
```

**Advanced Workflow Features:**
- **Matrix builds:** Test across multiple environments simultaneously
- **Conditional execution:** Run steps based on conditions
- **Secrets management:** Secure handling of API keys and credentials
- **Artifact storage:** Save build outputs for later use

**Real-world Example:** Microsoft uses GitHub Actions for all their open-source projects, processing millions of builds monthly  
**VelocityTech Connection:** GitHub Actions would ensure Luka's code builds consistently across all environments

### Build Automation and Artifact Management
**The Problem it Solves:** Manual build steps, missing dependencies, inconsistent artifact versioning, deployment confusion  
**How it Works:** Automated processes create consistent, versioned artifacts that can be deployed reliably

**Build Automation Components:**
- **Dependency Management:** Automatically install required packages
- **Environment Standardization:** Use consistent runtime versions
- **Build Scripts:** Automated compilation and packaging
- **Quality Checks:** Linting, security scanning, performance validation
- **Artifact Creation:** Package deployable units with version metadata

**Artifact Management Strategy:**
```
Build Process ‚Üí Artifact Storage ‚Üí Environment Deployment
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
  Package App   Version Control      Deploy Same
  Dependencies   Store Metadata      Artifact
  Run Tests      Security Scan       Environment
```

**Environment Parity Concepts:**
- **Development-Production Parity:** Minimize differences between environments
- **Configuration Management:** Environment-specific settings without code changes
- **Immutable Artifacts:** Same artifact deployed to all environments
- **Version Consistency:** Track exactly what's running where

**Real-world Example:** Spotify uses automated builds to deploy thousands of microservices consistently across environments  
**VelocityTech Connection:** Proper artifact management would eliminate "works on my machine" problems

**Key Takeaways:**
- CI catches integration problems immediately, not weeks later
- Automated builds eliminate human error and inconsistency
- Consistent environments prevent deployment surprises
- Artifact versioning enables reliable deployments and rollbacks

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab Mission: "The Build Factory Revolution"
**Scenario:** VelocityTech's payment gateway works only on Luka's laptop - client demo is tomorrow!  
**Your Mission:** Create automated CI pipeline that builds and tests code consistently across all environments  
**Success Criteria:** Payment gateway builds successfully from any developer's commit and works identically everywhere

### Phase 1: Repository Setup and Basic CI (45 minutes)
**Objective:** Create foundational GitHub Actions workflow for consistent builds

**Steps:**
1. **Initialize Standardized Project Structure**
   ```bash
   # Clone VelocityTech payment gateway repository
   git clone https://github.com/velocitytech/payment-gateway
   cd payment-gateway
   
   # Create consistent project structure
   mkdir -p .github/workflows src tests docs
   
   # Create package.json with specific versions
   cat > package.json << 'EOF'
   {
     "name": "velocitytech-payment-gateway",
     "version": "1.0.0",
     "engines": {
       "node": "18.17.0",
       "npm": "9.6.7"
     },
     "scripts": {
       "start": "node src/server.js",
       "test": "jest",
       "build": "npm run test && npm run lint",
       "lint": "eslint src/ --fix"
     },
     "dependencies": {
       "express": "4.18.2",
       "pg": "8.11.0",
       "joi": "17.9.2"
     },
     "devDependencies": {
       "jest": "29.5.0",
       "eslint": "8.42.0",
       "supertest": "6.3.3"
     }
   }
   EOF
   ```
   - Expected output: Consistent project structure with locked dependency versions
   - Troubleshooting: If npm install fails, check Node.js version compatibility

2. **Create Basic CI Workflow**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/ci.yml
   name: Continuous Integration
   
   on:
     push:
       branches: [ main, develop ]
     pull_request:
       branches: [ main ]
   
   jobs:
     test:
       name: Test and Build
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       
       strategy:
         matrix:
           node-version: [18.17.0]
       
       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v4
       
       - name: Setup Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
         uses: actions/setup-node@v3
         with:
           node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
           cache: 'npm'
       
       - name: Install dependencies
         run: |
           npm ci
           echo "Dependencies installed successfully"
       
       - name: Run linting
         run: |
           npm run lint
           echo "Code linting completed"
       
       - name: Run tests
         run: |
           npm test -- --coverage
           echo "Tests completed with coverage report"
       
       - name: Build application
         run: |
           npm run build
           echo "Application built successfully"
       
       - name: Upload test results
         uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
         if: always()
         with:
           name: test-results
           path: coverage/
   ```

3. **Test CI Pipeline**
   ```bash
   # Create simple application to test CI
   cat > src/payment-processor.js << 'EOF'
   class PaymentProcessor {
     constructor(config = {}) {
       this.apiEndpoint = config.apiEndpoint || 'https://api.payment.com';
       this.timeout = config.timeout || 5000;
     }
   
     async processPayment(paymentData) {
       this.validatePaymentData(paymentData);
       
       return {
         success: true,
         transactionId: `TXN_${Date.now()}`,
         amount: paymentData.amount,
         timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
       };
     }
   
     validatePaymentData(data) {
       if (!data.amount || data.amount <= 0) {
         throw new Error('Invalid payment amount');
       }
       if (!data.cardNumber || data.cardNumber.length < 13) {
         throw new Error('Invalid card number');
       }
       return true;
     }
   }
   
   module.exports = PaymentProcessor;
   EOF
   
   # Create corresponding tests
   cat > tests/payment-processor.test.js << 'EOF'
   const PaymentProcessor = require('../src/payment-processor');
   
   describe('PaymentProcessor', () => {
     let processor;
   
     beforeEach(() => {
       processor = new PaymentProcessor();
     });
   
     test('should process valid payment successfully', async () => {
       const paymentData = {
         amount: 100.00,
         cardNumber: '4111111111111111',
         expiryDate: '12/25',
         cvv: '123'
       };
   
       const result = await processor.processPayment(paymentData);
   
       expect(result.success).toBe(true);
       expect(result.transactionId).toMatch(/^TXN_\d+$/);
       expect(result.amount).toBe(100.00);
     });
   
     test('should reject payment with invalid amount', async () => {
       const paymentData = {
         amount: -50,
         cardNumber: '4111111111111111'
       };
   
       await expect(processor.processPayment(paymentData))
         .rejects.toThrow('Invalid payment amount');
     });
   
     test('should reject payment with invalid card number', async () => {
       const paymentData = {
         amount: 100,
         cardNumber: '123'
       };
   
       await expect(processor.processPayment(paymentData))
         .rejects.toThrow('Invalid card number');
     });
   });
   EOF
   
   # Push to trigger CI
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add CI pipeline with basic payment processor
   
   - Implement GitHub Actions workflow for consistent builds
   - Add payment processor with comprehensive tests
   - Ensure Node.js version consistency across environments"
   git push origin feature/ci-implementation
   ```

**Checkpoint:** GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully, all tests pass, artifact uploaded

### Phase 2: Environment Consistency and Build Optimization (75 minutes)
**Objective:** Ensure builds work identically across development, testing, and production environments

**Steps:**
1. **Create Environment Configuration Management**
   ```javascript
   // src/config/environment.js
   const environments = {
     development: {
       port: 3000,
       database: {
         host: 'localhost',
         port: 5432,
         database: 'payment_dev',
         user: process.env.DB_USER || 'dev_user',
         password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD || 'dev_password'
       },
       payment: {
         apiUrl: 'https://sandbox.payment.com',
         timeout: 10000
       }
     },
     
     test: {
       port: 3001,
       database: {
         host: process.env.DB_HOST || 'test-db',
         port: 5432,
         database: 'payment_test',
         user: process.env.DB_USER || 'test_user',
         password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD || 'test_password'
       },
       payment: {
         apiUrl: 'https://sandbox.payment.com',
         timeout: 5000
       }
     },
     
     production: {
       port: process.env.PORT || 8080,
       database: {
         host: process.env.DB_HOST,
         port: process.env.DB_PORT || 5432,
         database: process.env.DB_NAME,
         user: process.env.DB_USER,
         password: process.env.DB_PASSWORD
       },
       payment: {
         apiUrl: process.env.PAYMENT_API_URL,
         timeout: 30000
       }
     }
   };
   
   const getConfig = () => {
     const env = process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development';
     return environments[env];
   };
   
   module.exports = { getConfig };
   ```

2. **Enhanced CI Pipeline with Multiple Environments**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/ci-enhanced.yml

   ```

3. **Local Development Environment Standardization**
   ```bash
   # Create .nvmrc for Node version consistency
   echo "18.17.0" > .nvmrc
   
   # Create .env.example for environment variables
   cat > .env.example << 'EOF'
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=3000
   
   # Database Configuration
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_NAME=payment_dev
   DB_USER=dev_user
   DB_PASSWORD=dev_password
   
   # Payment Gateway Configuration
   PAYMENT_API_URL=https://sandbox.payment.com
   PAYMENT_API_KEY=your_sandbox_key_here
   EOF
   
   # Create setup script for new developers
   cat > scripts/setup-dev.sh << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   echo "Setting up VelocityTech Payment Gateway development environment..."
   
   # Check Node.js version
   if ! command -v node &> /dev/null; then
       echo "Node.js not found! Please install Node.js 18.17.0"
       exit 1
   fi
   
   NODE_VERSION=$(node -v)
   if [[ "$NODE_VERSION" != "v18.17.0" ]]; then
       echo "Warning: Expected Node.js v18.17.0, found $NODE_VERSION"
       echo "Consider using nvm: nvm use"
   fi
   
   # Install dependencies
   npm ci
   
   # Copy environment template
   if [ ! -f .env ]; then
       cp .env.example .env
       echo "Created .env file - please update with your configuration"
   fi
   
   # Run initial tests

   echo "Development environment setup complete!"
   echo "Run 'npm start' to start the development server"
   EOF
   
   chmod +x scripts/setup-dev.sh
   ```

4. **Create Build Status and Quality Badges**
   ```markdown
   # Add to README.md
   # VelocityTech Payment Gateway
   
   ![CI Status](https://github.com/velocitytech/payment-gateway/workflows/Enhanced%20CI%20Pipeline/badge.svg)

### Phase 3: Integration Testing and Deployment Pipeline (60 minutes)
**Objective:** Create end-to-end pipeline that validates builds before deployment

**Steps:**
1. **Integration Test Environment Setup**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/integration-tests.yml
   name: Integration Tests
   
   on:
     workflow_run:
       workflows: ["Enhanced CI Pipeline"]
       types:
         - completed
   
   jobs:
     integration-tests:
       name: Run Integration Tests
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' }}
       
       services:
         postgres:
           image: postgres:14
           env:
             POSTGRES_PASSWORD: integration_password
             POSTGRES_USER: integration_user
             POSTGRES_DB: payment_integration
           options: >-
             --health-cmd pg_isready

             --health-timeout 5s
             --health-retries 5
           ports:
             - 5432:5432
         
         redis:
           image: redis:7-alpine
           options: >-
             --health-cmd "redis-cli ping"
             --health-interval 10s
             --health-timeout 5s
             --health-retries 5
           ports:
             - 6379:6379

       - name: Setup Node.js
         uses: actions/setup-node@v3
         with:
           node-version: '18.17.0'
           cache: 'npm'
       
       - name: Setup integration environment
         env:

           DB_NAME: payment_integration
           REDIS_URL: redis://localhost:6379
         run: |
           npm ci
           npm run migrate:test
           npm run seed:test
       
       - name: Run integration tests

           echo "Integration tests completed successfully"
       
       - name: Run performance tests
         run: |
           npm run test:performance
           echo "Performance tests completed"
       
       - name: Generate test report

         with:
           name: integration-test-report
           path: reports/
   ```

2. **Create Comprehensive Integration Tests**
   ```javascript
   // tests/integration/payment-flow.test.js
   const request = require('supertest');
   const app = require('../../src/app');
   const { getConfig } = require('../../src/config/environment');

     });
   
     test('complete payment flow works end-to-end', async () => {
       const paymentRequest = {
         amount: 150.00,
         currency: 'EUR',

       const sessionResponse = await request(app)
         .post('/api/payments/sessions')
         .send({ amount: paymentRequest.amount, currency: paymentRequest.currency })
         .expect(201);
   
       expect(sessionResponse.body.sessionId).toBeDefined();
       expect(sessionResponse.body.expiresAt).toBeDefined();
   
       // Step 2: Process payment
       const paymentResponse = await request(app)
         .post(`/api/payments/sessions/${sessionResponse.body.sessionId}/process`)
         .send(paymentRequest)
         .expect(200);
   
       expect(paymentResponse.body.success).toBe(true);
       expect(paymentResponse.body.transactionId).toBeDefined();
       expect(paymentResponse.body.amount).toBe(150.00);
   
       // Step 3: Verify payment record in database
       const dbRecord = await findPaymentRecord(paymentResponse.body.transactionId);
       expect(dbRecord).toBeDefined();
       expect(dbRecord.status).toBe('completed');
   
       // Step 4: Verify notification was sent
       const notifications = await getTestNotifications();
       expect(notifications.length).toBe(1);
       expect(notifications[0].recipient).toBe('test@velocitytech.com');
     });
   
     test('handles payment failures gracefully', async () => {
       const invalidPayment = {
         amount: 999999.99, // Amount that triggers test failure
         cardNumber: '4000000000000002', // Test card that always fails
         expiryDate: '12/25',
         cvv: '123'
       };
   
       const response = await request(app)
         .post('/api/payments/process')
         .send(invalidPayment)
         .expect(400);
   
       expect(response.body.success).toBe(false);
       expect(response.body.error).toContain('payment failed');
       
       // Verify no charge was made
       const charges = await getTestCharges();
       expect(charges.length).toBe(0);
     });
   
     test('load test - handles multiple concurrent payments', async () => {
       const concurrentPayments = 50;
       const paymentPromises = [];
   
       for (let i = 0; i < concurrentPayments; i++) {
         const paymentPromise = request(app)
           .post('/api/payments/process')
           .send({
             amount: 10.00 + i,
             cardNumber: '4111111111111111',
             expiryDate: '12/25',
             cvv: '123'
           });
         paymentPromises.push(paymentPromise);
       }
   
       const results = await Promise.all(paymentPromises);
       
       // All payments should succeed
       results.forEach(result => {
         expect(result.status).toBe(200);
         expect(result.body.success).toBe(true);
       });
   
       // Performance check - all should complete within reasonable time
       expect(results.length).toBe(concurrentPayments);
     });
   });
   ```

3. **Deployment Pipeline Configuration**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   name: Deploy to Staging
   
   on:
     workflow_run:
       workflows: ["Integration Tests"]
       types:
         - completed
       branches:
         - main
   
   jobs:
     deploy-staging:
       name: Deploy to Staging Environment
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'success' }}
       
       environment:
         name: staging
         url: https://staging.velocitytech.com
       
       steps:
       - name: Checkout code
         uses: actions/checkout@v4
       
       - name: Download verified build artifact
         uses: actions/download-artifact@v3
         with:
           name: payment-gateway-build
       
       - name: Deploy to staging
         env:
           DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.STAGING_DEPLOY_KEY }}
           STAGING_SERVER: ${{ secrets.STAGING_SERVER }}
         run: |
           echo "Deploying build ${{ github.sha }} to staging..."
           
           # Extract artifact
           tar -xzf payment-gateway-${{ github.sha }}.tar.gz
           
           # Deploy using your preferred method (rsync, scp, etc.)
           # This is a placeholder - replace with your actual deployment process
           echo "Deployment to staging completed successfully"
       
       - name: Run smoke tests on staging
         run: |
           # Wait for deployment to be ready
           sleep 30
           
           # Run basic smoke tests
           curl -f https://staging.velocitytech.com/health || exit 1
           curl -f https://staging.velocitytech.com/api/payments/health || exit 1
           
           echo "Staging smoke tests passed"
       
       - name: Notify team of deployment
         run: |
           echo "üöÄ Payment Gateway v${{ github.sha }} deployed to staging successfully!" 
           echo "Staging URL: https://staging.velocitytech.com"
           echo "All tests passed, ready for UAT"
   ```

**Checkpoint:** Complete CI/CD pipeline from commit to staging deployment with quality gates

### Validation & Testing
**How to verify everything works:**
1. **CI Pipeline Test** - `Push code change and verify GitHub Actions runs successfully`
2. **Multi-Environment Test** - `Verify builds work on Node 16, 18, and 20`
3. **Integration Test** - `Complete payment flow works in test environment`
4. **Artifact Test** - `Download and deploy build artifact successfully`

**Expected Results:**
- **Build Time:** Under 5 minutes for complete CI pipeline
- **Environment Consistency:** 100% - code works identically everywhere
- **Test Coverage:** 95%+ with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- **Deployment Success Rate:** 98%+ - reliable, repeatable deployments
- **Developer Experience:** One-command setup for new team members

## üîß New Tools in Your Arsenal

### GitHub Actions Workflow Engine
- **Purpose:** Automate build, test, and deployment processes triggered by code changes
- **Key Components:**
  - `on: [push, pull_request]` - Define workflow triggers
  - `strategy.matrix` - Test across multiple environments
  - `services:` - Spin up databases and dependencies
- **Pro Tips:** Use caching to speed up builds, pin action versions for stability
- **Common Pitfalls:** Don't put secrets in workflow files, use environment variables

### Build Artifact Management
- **Purpose:** Create consistent, versioned packages that can be deployed anywhere
- **Key Features:**
  - `actions/upload-artifact` - Store build outputs
  - `actions/download-artifact` - Retrieve builds for deployment
  - Version tagging with Git SHA or semantic versioning
- **Pro Tips:** Include metadata in artifacts, set appropriate retention policies
- **Common Pitfalls:** Don't include development dependencies in production builds

### Environment Configuration Management
- **Purpose:** Handle different settings across development, test, and production
- **Key Strategies:**
  - Environment-specific config files
  - Environment variables for sensitive data
  - Configuration validation on startup
- **Pro Tips:** Use .env.example as template, validate required config on app start
- **Common Pitfalls:** Never commit secrets to git, always have fallback defaults

## üîß Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue #1: "Build works locally but fails in CI"
**Symptoms:** Local npm install succeeds, but GitHub Actions fails with dependency errors
**Cause:** Local cache has different versions than fresh CI environment
**Solution:**
```bash
# Use npm ci instead of npm install in CI
npm ci  # Installs exactly what's in package-lock.json

# Clear local cache to match CI behavior
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```
**Prevention:** Always commit package-lock.json, use exact versions in package.json

### Issue #2: "Tests pass individually but fail when run together"
**Symptoms:** Each test passes in isolation, but running full suite causes failures
**Cause:** Tests sharing state, database connections not properly cleaned up
**Solution:**
```javascript
// Add proper cleanup in test files
afterEach(async () => {
  await cleanupDatabase();
  await closeConnections();
});

// Use test isolation
beforeEach(async () => {
  await seedFreshTestData();
});
```
**Prevention:** Design tests to be independent, use test databases, mock external services

### Issue #3: "CI pipeline is too slow"
**Symptoms:** GitHub Actions takes 15+ minutes, developers avoid running CI
**Cause:** Not using caching, running unnecessary steps, slow test setup
**Solution:**
```yaml
# Add strategic caching
- name: Cache dependencies
  uses: actions/cache@v3
  with:
    path: ~/.npm
    key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}

# Parallelize jobs
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        test-group: [unit, integration, e2e]
```
**Prevention:** Use parallel jobs, cache dependencies, optimize test data setup
